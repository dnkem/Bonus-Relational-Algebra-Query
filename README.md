Program Title: Relational Algebra Query

Description:
  This program represents relational algebra queries between 3 relations, Employee, Grad Students, and Department. The Employee has 4 attributes, the id, name, age, and department.
  The Grad students have 4 attributes, the id, name, age, and email. The Department relation has 2 attributes, the name, and budget. For the sake of simplicity and testing, I have 2 sets of 
  given tuples for each of the relations, however, there is the ability to add to them and print them. Please note I imported pandas via pip.

Execution & Instruction:
  To execute this program, enter 'python3 Bonus.py' then enter one of the 10 options.

Things to improve:
  - Continue to refactor code by reading about mutable code to pass DataFrames as arguments.
